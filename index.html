                <div class="intro">My love of story began early-on in my life, as I read sci-fi and fantasy books on the floor of every book store I found myself. After attempting to scratch that writing itch as a reporter in the middle of nowhere, Texas—and after losing a part of my soul working for a social media company—I decided the only course of action left was to disappoint my parents by telling them, "I think I want to write creatively." Now, I have my very own website!</div>
